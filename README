About
============================================================================
SleekBot is an easily extendable Bot for XMPP (aka Jabber, Google Talk, etc)
written in Python using the elegant SleekXMPP library.

I have upgraded the api calls to be compatible with SleekXMPP 0.9c
Additionally, I have taken some ideas from Thomas Perl's Jabberbot
(http://thpinfo.com/2007/python-jabberbot/) and incorporated them into SleekBot.
